    "* derivative allows us to describe rate of change of a function, rise over run\n",
    "* first derivative is geometrically interpreted as tangent to a function in a given point\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)$ => Leibnitz and Lagrange notations\n",
    "* potential extremes of a function at points where $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "* can be analytically expressed from the definition $lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}$\n",
    "* polynomials & power funcs $f'(x^n) = nx^{(n-1)}$\n",
    "* trigonometric funcs $f'(sinx) = cosx, \\hspace{0.1cm} f'(cosx) = -sinx$ (nice expression using unitary circle)\n",
    "* exponetials $f'(e^x) = e^x$ (geometrical series)\n",
    "* logarithms $f'(ln x) = \\frac{1}{x}$\n",

    "* non-differentiable functions: non-smooth, non-continuous, vertical tangent (non-defined tangent slope)\n",

    "    * log-loss is $-G(p)$ (as log is negative for probs)"
